# 🖋️ 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙨 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙒𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙨

Responsive website made for the course "𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮" dictated by 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗼 𝗮 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗼 𝟰.𝟬.

This website was built thinking of a company that organizes conferences and events for writers.

I developed 3 HTML pages: 𝗛𝗼𝗺𝗲, 𝗧𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁𝘀 and 𝟰𝟬𝟰𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿.

##  𝗛𝗼𝗺𝗲 
 
🏠 NavBar with the company logo and navigation menu.

🏠 Presentation of the page with background image and most important navigation buttons.
